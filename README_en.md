# "oft2mailto" by KeigoYAMAZAKI (@ymzkei5)
Converter for Outlook (classic) user template files (*.oft) to 'mailto:' links  

## What is this?
* This tool converts Outlook (classic) "user template" (.oft) files into "mailto:" links.
* One concern when migrating from Outlook (classic) to Outlook (new) is the lack of template functionality.
* By converting template files to "mailto:" links, users can create emails with just a click.

## How to Use
* Download the oft2mailto-verX_XX.zip file from the dist/ directory to your local machine.
* Extract the ZIP file (running directly from the compressed folder may cause failure).
* Run oft2mailto.exe.
* If the conversion is successful, the result will be output to result.html.

## Limitations
* Due to the "mailto:" specification, links may not be created correctly if the body text is too long.
